# nodejs-test
Test task for Node jS developers. Candidate should write a simple NPM package banking application in Typescript language.

## General acceptance criteria
- [x] All code is in git repo (candidate can use his/her own github account).
- [x] Package name can be derived from ExBanking
- [x] Package simply exports just an initializer of the ExBanking module (no API endpoint, no REST / SOAP API, no TCP / UDP sockets, no any external network interface).
- [x] Application should not use any database / disc storage. All needed data should be stored only in application memory.
- [x] Candidate can use any Node library he/she wants to, the code itself should be written using Typescript and transpiled to Javascript.
- [x] We expect unit tests.
- [x] Code accuracy also matters. Readable, safe, refactorable code is a plus.

## Money amounts
- [x] Money amount of any currency should not be negative.
- [x] Application should provide 2 decimal precision of money amount for any currency.
- [x] Amount of money incoming to the system should be equal to amount of money inside the system + amount of withdraws (money should not appear or disappear accidentally).
- [x] User and currency type is any string. Case sensitive. New currencies / users can be added dynamically in runtime. In the application, there should be a special public function (described below) for creating users. Currencies should be created automatically (if needed).

## API reference
Requirements for public functions provided by ExBanking package. Any function should return success result or error result. Success result is different for each function, error result is generic.

```typescript
type BankingError = Error | 
  WrongArguments | 
  UserAlreadyExists | 
  UserDoesNotExist |
  NotEnoughMoney | 
  SenderDoesNotExist | 
  ReceiverDoesNotExist;

type Ok = { success: true };
```

```typescript
const createUser = (username: string): Ok | BankingError => {};
```
- [x] Function creates new user in the system
- [x] New user has zero balance of any currency

```typescript
const deposit = (username: string, amount: number, currency: string): (Ok & { newBalance: number } | BankingError) => {};
```
- [x] Increases user's balance in given currency by amount value
- [x] Returns newBalance of the user in given format

```typescript
const withdraw = (username: string, amount: number, currency: string): (Ok & { newBalance: number } | BankingError) => {};
```
- [x] Decreases user's balance in given currency by amount value
- [x] Returns new_balance of the user in given format

```typescript
const getBalance = (username: string, currency: string): (Ok & { balance: number } | BankingError) => {};
```
- [x] Returns balance of the user in given format

```typescript
const send = (fromUsername: string, toUsername: string, amount: number, currency: string): (Ok & { fromUsernameBalance: number, toUsernameBalance: number } | BankingError) => {};
```
- [x] Decreases fromUsername's balance in given currency by amount value
- [x] Increases toUsername's balance in given currency by amount value
- [x] Returns balance of fromUser and toUser in given format
